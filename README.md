- **Smart city search** with autocomplete suggestions as you type  
- **Responsive design** that adapts to any screen size  
- **Dynamic weather icons** that match current conditions  
- **Error handling** with friendly messages for invalid locations  
- **Sleek glassmorphism design** with blur effects and gradient backgrounds  

### **Behind the Scenes** 🔧  
- **Built with**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
